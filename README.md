# IR_RC_TMR
  Code applies to most Japan style IR remote control units except for timer function.
  Main features:
     -AVR ATMega328p 
     -Interrupt driven
     -Uses one 16bit timer
     -Has 24bit data length, tried to make it flexible, though
     -Serial port(TX) debug
     -RTC
     -Facilities to read button codes and also programmable timer
     -Uses currently some 20+ year old Schneider remote control codes

Have fun! :)
